Additionally here are some quick suggestions for better performance in TTI SP, especially when not using dedicated server mode and hosting on your own local PC

Doing a handful of these or all of these will greatly improve performance. The main things that cause performance drops are:
-Moving Ground Units
-Search Radars
-Search and detection scripts (JTAC autolasing)
-Mass amount of active units in general

*** Disable moving units

- Turn off AI Troop Drop off

- Turn off AI ground vehicle reinforcements (friendly)

- Turn off AI ground vehicle reinforcements (enemy)

- Turn off convoy mission (ground)
convoy_missions_autostart = true/false

- Turn off convoy mission (ships)
a2g_ship_convoy_smm_enable = true/false
ship_convoy_missions_autostart = true/false


*** Only enable the missions you fly

- Use single mission mode, 
singleRandomMissionModeEnabled= true/false

- Ensure the random mission types are the ones you desire 
for single mission mode:

a2g_easy_smm_enable = true/false
a2g_hard_smm_enable = true/false
a2g_sead_smm_enable= true/false
a2g_helo_smm_enable = true/false
a2g_inf_smm_enable = true/false
a2g_convoy_smm_enable = true/false
a2g_ship_convoy_smm_enable = true/false
a2g_as_smm_enable = true/false

- Only set few auto-spawn missions that you actually do
a2g_easy_autostart = true/false
a2g_hard_autostart = true/false
a2g_sead_autostart= true/false
a2g_helo_autostart = true/false
a2g_helo_inf_autostart = true/false
antiship_autostart= true/false


- Use manually spawning mission. Nothing spawns unless you ask for it
See above, set all to false


*** Disable some or all of the RANDOM AIR TRAFFIC
random_blue_large_civ_air_traffic = true/false
random_blue_large_mil_air_traffic = true/false
random_blue_fighter_air_traffic = true/false
random_red_air_large_civ_traffic= true/false
random_red_air_large_mil_traffic = true/false
random_red_air_fighter_traffic = true/false


*** Reduce the amount of units at each ground missions, especially search radars (SAMs)
(values are the default ones)
a2g_hard_misc = 13
a2g_hard_aa = 3
a2g_hard_sam_easy = 1
a2g_hard_sam_hard = 1

a2g_easy_misc = 13
a2g_easy_aa = 0
a2g_easy_sam_easy = 0
a2g_easy_sam_hard = 0

a2g_sead_misc = 0
a2g_sead_aa = 2
a2g_sead_sam_easy = 1
a2g_sead_sam_hard = 2

a2g_helo_misc = 10
a2g_helo_aa = 2
a2g_helo_sam_easy = 0
a2g_helo_sam_hard = 0

a2g_inf_troops = 37
a2g_inf_misc = 4
a2g_inf_aa = 0
a2g_inf_sam_easy = 0
a2g_inf_sam_hard = 0

a2g_antiship = 2

*** Disable default features you do not use

- Airboss
airboss_enable = true/false


- ATIS
atis_enable = true/false

- Carrier Deck Statics that spawn in at mission start
enable_sc_cvn_deck_template_on_start = true/false
